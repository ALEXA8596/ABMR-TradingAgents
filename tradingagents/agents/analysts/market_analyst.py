                    This is part of a multi-ticker portfolio analysis, but you should focus ONLY on {ticker} right now.
                    
                    Your role is to select the **most relevant indicators** for {ticker} from the following comprehensive list. 
                    The goal is to choose up to **8 indicators** that provide complementary insights without redundancy. 
                    Categories and each category's indicators are:

Basic Price Analysis:
- delta: Price change between periods
- log: Log return calculation
- max: Maximum price in range
- min: Minimum price in range
- middle: (close + high + low) / 3 - typical price
- compare: Price comparisons (le, ge, lt, gt, eq, ne)
- count: Count occurrences (both backward and forward)
- cross: Upward and downward crossover signals

Moving Averages:
- close_50_sma: 50 SMA: A medium-term trend indicator. Usage: Identify trend direction and serve as dynamic support/resistance. Tips: It lags price; combine with faster indicators for timely signals.
- close_200_sma: 200 SMA: A long-term trend benchmark. Usage: Confirm overall market trend and identify golden/death cross setups. Tips: It reacts slowly; best for strategic trend confirmation rather than frequent trading entries.
- close_10_ema: 10 EMA: A responsive short-term average. Usage: Capture quick shifts in momentum and potential entry points. Tips: Prone to noise in choppy markets; use alongside longer averages for filtering false signals.
- dma: Different of Moving Average (10, 50): Shows divergence between short and long-term trends
- tema: Triple Exponential Moving Average: Reduces lag while maintaining smoothness
- kama: Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average: Adjusts to market volatility automatically
- boll: Bollinger Bands: Volatility-based envelope indicator. Usage: Identify overbought/oversold conditions and potential breakout zones. Tips: Bands contract in low volatility and expand in high volatility; use with other indicators for confirmation.
- boll_mb: Bollinger Middle Band: The moving average center line. Usage: Core trend reference and mean reversion target. Tips: Acts as dynamic support/resistance; price often returns to this line.
- boll_lb: Bollinger Lower Band: Typically 2 standard deviations below the middle line. Usage: Indicates potential oversold conditions. Tips: Use additional analysis to avoid false reversal signals.
- atr: ATR: Averages true range to measure volatility. Usage: Set stop-loss levels and adjust position sizes based on current market volatility. Tips: It's a reactive measure, so use it as part of a broader risk management strategy.
- tr: True Range: Single-period volatility measure
- mad: Mean Absolute Deviation: Alternative volatility measure
- z: Z-Score: Standardized price deviation from mean

MACD Related:
- macd: MACD: Computes momentum via differences of EMAs. Usage: Look for crossovers and divergence as signals of trend changes. Tips: Confirm with other indicators in low-volatility or sideways markets.
- macds: MACD Signal: An EMA smoothing of the MACD line. Usage: Use crossovers with the MACD line to trigger trades. Tips: Should be part of a broader strategy to avoid false positives.
- macdh: MACD Histogram: Shows the gap between the MACD line and its signal. Usage: Visualize momentum strength and spot divergence early. Tips: Can be volatile; complement with additional filters in fast-moving markets.

Momentum Indicators:
- rsi: RSI: Measures momentum to flag overbought/oversold conditions. Usage: Apply 70/30 thresholds and watch for divergence to signal reversals. Tips: In strong trends, RSI may remain extreme; always cross-check with trend analysis.
- rsv: Raw Stochastic Value: Basic stochastic calculation before smoothing
- kdj: Stochastic Oscillator: Enhanced stochastic with J-line for early signals
- stochrsi: Stochastic RSI: Combines RSI with stochastic formula for enhanced sensitivity
- wr: Williams %R: Overbought/oversold oscillator similar to stochastic
- roc: Rate of Change: Momentum indicator measuring percentage price change
- ao: Awesome Oscillator: Measures momentum using 5 and 34-period moving averages
- ppo: Percentage Price Oscillator: MACD expressed as percentage
- ker: Kaufman's Efficiency Ratio: Measures trend strength vs noise
- inertia: Inertia Indicator: Momentum measure using linear regression
- kst: Know Sure Thing: Smoothed momentum oscillator using multiple timeframes
- pgo: Pretty Good Oscillator: Normalized price oscillator

Trend & Directional Indicators:
- dmi: Directional Movement Index system including:
- pdi: +DI: Positive Directional Indicator - measures upward price movement
- mdi: -DI: Negative Directional Indicator - measures downward price movement
- adx: Average Directional Movement Index: Measures trend strength
- adxr: Smoothed Moving Average of ADX: Less volatile version of ADX
- trix: Triple Exponential Moving Average: Momentum oscillator with triple smoothing
- aroon: Aroon Oscillator: Measures time since highest high and lowest low
- cti: Correlation Trend Indicator: Measures price correlation with time
- supertrend: Trend following indicator with upper and lower bands

Volume-Based Indicators:
- vwma: VWMA: A moving average weighted by volume. Usage: Confirm trends by integrating price action with volume data. Tips: Watch for skewed results from volume spikes; use in combination with other volume analyses.
- vr: Volume Variation Index: Compares current volume to historical average
- mfi: Money Flow Index: Volume-weighted RSI combining price and volume
- pvo: Percentage Volume Oscillator: MACD applied to volume data

Specialized Oscillators:
- cci: Commodity Channel Index: Measures deviation from statistical mean
- cr: Energy Index (Intermediate Willingness Index): Measures buying/selling pressure
- wt: LazyBear's Wave Trend: Smoothed momentum oscillator
- chop: Choppiness Index: Determines if market is trending or sideways
- bop: Balance of Power: Measures buying vs selling pressure
- eri: Elder-Ray Index: Shows bull and bear power
- ftr: Gaussian Fisher Transform: Normalizes price data for clearer signals
- rvgi: Relative Vigor Index: Measures conviction of price movement
- psl: Psychological Line: Percentage of up days over specified period
- qqe: Quantitative Qualitative Estimation: Smoothed RSI-based indicator

Advanced Analysis:
- ichimoku: Ichimoku Cloud: Complete trend analysis system with multiple components
- coppock: Coppock Curve: Long-term momentum indicator for major trend changes

- Select indicators that provide diverse and complementary information for {ticker} specifically. Avoid redundancy (e.g., do not select both rsi and stochrsi unless specifically needed). Also briefly explain why they are suitable for {ticker} in the given market context. When you tool call, please use the exact name of the indicators provided above as they are defined parameters, otherwise your call will fail. Please make sure to call get_YFin_data first to retrieve the CSV that is needed to generate indicators. Write a very detailed and nuanced report of the trends you observe for {ticker}. Do not simply state the trends are mixed, provide detailed and finegrained analysis and insights that may help traders make decisions."""
