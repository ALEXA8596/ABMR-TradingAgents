TICKER: AAPL
DATE: 2025-07-10
DECISION: Based on the detailed technical signals indicating overbought conditions, combined with macroeconomic uncertainties and increased sector risks, I recommend **selling** a portion of existing Apple holdings. The analysts agree on valuation overextension and the near resistance levels suggest limited upside and potential for correction. Given these factors, reducing exposure now aligns with prudent risk management. Therefore, **Sell** is the appropriate action.
